# Flan36 Outline — SVG kit

The selected Outline concept is now an editable, font-free vector. Its symbol and six letters are closed filled Bézier paths; the four internal holes remain open. Color and monochrome exports share the same outline geometry.

| File | Use | SVG page width |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `flan36-outline-master.svg` | Editable source; symbol and each letter have a named path | 30 mm |
| `flan36-outline-black.svg` | Complete logo, one ink; starting point for graphics import | 30 mm |
| `flan36-outline-white.svg` | Reversed logo on a dark background | 30 mm |
| `flan36-outline-color.svg` | Flat caramel/custard identity | 30 mm |
| `flan36-outline-symbol-black.svg` | Symbol alone, one ink; starting point for a small case/PCB mark | 12 mm |
| `flan36-outline-symbol-white.svg` | Reversed symbol | 12 mm |
| `flan36-outline-symbol-color.svg` | Color symbol | 12 mm |
| `flan36-outline-wordmark-black.svg` | Lettering alone, already converted to paths | 30 mm |

Backgrounds are transparent. White exports need a dark background to be visible. `preview.svg` is a presentation sheet, **not** a manufacturing master; its labels use a system font. The logo SVGs have no fonts, raster images, live strokes, masks or external resources.

## PCB: KiCad

Import the black logo or symbol through **File → Import → Graphics**, set scale to **1**, select **F.SilkS** (or B.SilkS for a back-side mark), and group the imported items. Inspect the actual size and back-side orientation. Keep the mark clear of exposed pads, existing legends and mounting holes; check the fabricator's minimum line/space rules at the final scale. [KiCad graphics-import documentation](https://docs.kicad.org/10.0/en/pcbnew/pcbnew.html#importing-vector-graphics).

These are page widths with a tiny artboard margin, not approved placement dimensions. No logo is placed on the keyboard PCB by this kit. KiCad placement and final fabrication output still need checking.

## Case: FreeCAD

Import the black logo or symbol as **SVG as geometry (importSVG)**. The imported paths can form faces for an emboss or a pocket. Select the symbol alone for a compact mark, or all seven faces for the complete logo. [FreeCAD SVG workflow](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-documentation/blob/main/wiki/Import_text_and_geometry_from_Inkscape.md).

The supplied black logo, symbol and wordmark were imported headlessly into FreeCAD 1.1.3: dimensions, counters and valid trial extrusions were checked. This does not qualify a cut in a case wall. Choose the final placement and relief depth against the actual wall, ribs, battery and joining features. No case geometry is changed by this kit.

## Edit and regenerate

Edit `flan36-outline-master.svg` in a vector editor. For the repository generator, keep the seven named top-level paths, explicit absolute M/C/Z commands, no transforms and `fill-rule="evenodd"`; closed cubic contours keep the import path simple. Color fills are derived from the two holes in the symbol, so color variants do not drift from the master.

From the repository root, use a Python environment with `tools/requirements-branding.txt`:

```sh
python tools/build_outline_logo.py --png --package
python tools/check_outline_logo.py
python tools/freecad/run_macos.py tools/freecad/check_outline_logo.py
```

CairoSVG needs the Cairo system library for PNG rendering and raster readback. On macOS with Homebrew Cairo, prefix the first two commands with `DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/lib`. The last command uses the existing macOS FreeCAD installation and opens no GUI. On other platforms, run `tools/freecad/check_outline_logo.py` in a FreeCAD Python environment.

`--trace` intentionally recreates the master from the selected concept and **replaces manual master edits**. Normal regeneration omits that flag. The vector trace uses the bottom-left monochrome reference from `docs/images/branding/flan36-caramel-outline.png`; earlier concept boards remain historical references.

The kit contains SVG art, this guide, a hash manifest and the repository license. It contains no placed PCB artwork, case cut, G-code or print-process approval. [Source and provenance](https://github.com/eduarbo/filo36/blob/main/design/branding-outline-vectors.json).
